**Siam Ashraful** — Halifax, NS  
Computer Science @ Dalhousie (2024). I care about clear data flows, usable interfaces, and building with rigor.  
I’ve supported data lineage and metadata initiatives (CDE documentation, risk mapping, Collibra uploads), and I’m deeply curious about how AI augments analysis and design.

Outside of work, I explore startup ideas, write notes on process and craft, and tinker with lightweight tools.
