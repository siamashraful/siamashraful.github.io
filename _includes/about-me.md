## About Me

Hi, I’m **Siam Ashraful** — a Computer Science graduate from **Dalhousie University**, currently based in **Halifax, Nova Scotia**.  

I work at **RBC** as a **Data Analyst** on the Data Traceability & Controls team, where I help strengthen data integrity and compliance by documenting data flows, assessing risk, and supporting audit readiness across critical systems.  

My background bridges **data analysis**, **software development**, and **user-focused design** — I’ve worked with everything from backend logic and SQL transformations to visual tools like **Visio** and **Figma**. Along the way, I’ve also contributed to AI evaluation projects, technical support operations, and community initiatives focused on accessibility and sustainability.  

I’m passionate about **turning complex systems into clear, meaningful insights** — whether that means building smarter workflows, designing intuitive interfaces, or helping teams communicate data more effectively.  

Outside of work, I’m always exploring emerging AI technologies, experimenting with design ideas, or brainstorming startup concepts that merge creativity with analytics.
