# About Me

Hi, I'm **Siam Ashraful**, a recent **Computer Science graduate from Dalhousie University**, with a strong interest in **software development**, **UI/UX design**, and **data analysis**. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **C**, along with practical experience in **web development**, **database management (SQL)**, and **mobile app design**. I'm passionate about building intuitive, user-centered solutions—whether through clean interfaces, reliable systems, or innovative digital tools.

Currently, I’m working as an **AI Writing Evaluator at Outlier.ai**, where I assess and improve AI-generated content. This role has enhanced my analytical and communication skills while deepening my interest in the future of **AI-assisted technologies**.

During my time at university, I was actively involved in various leadership and volunteer roles. As a **residence staff member**, I mentored new team members and contributed to building inclusive and supportive student communities. Through my volunteer work with organizations like **The Loaded Ladle** and **Banglar Pathshala**, I developed strong **teamwork**, **event coordination**, and **community outreach** skills—all of which continue to influence how I work and collaborate today.

I'm currently focused on developing my skills in **front-end development**, **Agile workflows**, and **user experience research**. This site is a portfolio of my ongoing professional journey, including my **resume**, **projects**, and areas of **continuous learning**.

Thanks for visiting!
